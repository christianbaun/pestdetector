TODO list for pestdetector
==========================
* Automatic startup at boot on the node.
* Use two log files. One for program output and one just to inform about detected objects with date and time information.
* Telegram bot setup and interaction.
* Increase performance. Approx. 15 seconds per program run is too long. Maybe reduce image resolution.
  => The performance of libcamera-still from libcamera is better compared with the legacy raspistill tool
